# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

This challenge is about creating a simple Product Card Component that adapts to different screen sizes with small changes in its layout. I've decided to use Sass to create reusable code, separating the variables from the stylesheet, so that they can be easily updated.
